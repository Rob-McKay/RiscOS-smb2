RISC OS libsmb2
===============

This is the RISC OS version of libsmb2 built with the DDE.

Currently, I've got the library and a couple of examples working under RISC OS 5.

I plan to add a module wrapper to the library to enable to it to be used from environments other than the DDE and allow it to be used without forcing clients to be released under a (L)GPL licence.
